# Project Templates

In addition to the default project template, the Middleman community has created a lot of custom templates. There are also a number of [community-developed project templates](https://directory.middlemanapp.com/#/templates/all). Custom templates are installed via Github (so make sure you have `git` installed), simply pass the `username/reponame` to the `init` command. For example:

``` bash
$ middleman init my_new_boilerplate_project --template=danielbayerlein/middleman-casper
```
