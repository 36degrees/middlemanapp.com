# LiveReload

Middleman comes with full support for the LiveReload browser extension via the Guard project. If you have installed the LiveReload extension in your browser, you can have Middleman automatically tell the browser to refresh upon changes to your source code. To do this, you will need to start the Middleman server in LiveReload mode:

    middleman server --livereload

Now, browsers using the LiveReload extension can connect to Middleman and automatically refresh after you update your code.
